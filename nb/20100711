nb relational operator
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator

This usage of "=" in these "C-syntax" languages can lead to coding errors.
A programmer may mistype "if (x = y)" instead of "if (x == y)".
In C, the former code fragment roughly means "assign y to x, and if the
new value of x is not zero, execute the statement following".
The latter code fragment roughly means "if and only if x is equal to y,
execute the statement following".
