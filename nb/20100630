nb startup hire interview code question clang reverse linked list thread coroutine condition variable @rethinkdb
Slava.   20100629.  Will the real programmers please stand up?
RethinkDB Blog.

Why do we ask these specific questions?  Because they’re part of a core
body of knowledge taught in any undergraduate curriculum worth its salt,
and because in some form or another, they came up in our daily work.
And in four months we found out that if you understand the difference
between threads and coroutines, can reverse a linked list, and have a
basic understanding of condition variables, chances are you’re probably
a much better programmer than most who are looking for a job, and a huge
chunk of those who aren’t looking as well.

Some of us are still wishing and hoping for the real deal, a GNU
operating system with a GNU kernel.  The choice of the Mach microkernel,
which seemed so wise in 1987/90, may have proved to be the wrong choice
(although NeXT and Apple made it work for OSX).  But without the initial
drive to get there, and the development of the GNU tools and the GPL,
Linux might never have become what it has become, and the lessons learnt
from the HURD's journey through the backwaters of operating system
design may yet prove to be the base for what follows after.


nb bdd behavior driven development natural language tdd
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development

BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software
behaviour through discussion with stakeholders.  It extends TDD by
writing test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read.
Behavior-driven developers use their native language in combination with
the /ubiquitous language/ of domain driven design to describe the
purpose and benefit of their code.  This allows the developers to focus
on why the code should be created, rather than the technical details,
and minimizes translation between the technical language in which the
code is written and the domain language spoken by the business, users,
stakeholders, project management etc.

nb malware conficker worm @theatlantic

When the Conficker computer “worm” was unleashed on the world in
November 2008, cyber-security experts didn’t know what to make of it.
It infiltrated millions of computers around the globe.  It constantly
checks in with its unknown creators.  It uses an encryption code so
sophisticated that only a very few people could have deployed it.
For the first time ever, the cyber-security elites of the world have
joined forces in a high-tech game of cops and robbers, trying to find
Conficker’s creators and defeat them.  The cops are failing.  And now
the worm lies there, waiting …
