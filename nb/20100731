Marz, N.  20100526.  Why your company should have a very permissive open
source policy.  Thoughts from the red planet.

Open source is an equalizer.  An open source project shows how a
programmer goes about solving real problems that didn't have serviceable
solutions yet.  An open source project has much greater scope than
anything that can be given to a programmer in a job interview and shows
the kind of quality work a programmer produces from design to
implementation to testing.  If you're an awesome programmer, this means
you can significantly reduce that gap between perceived and actual value
and be priced more fairly in the job market.  The more mispriced a
programmer, the more that programmer should desire being involved in
open source to normalize his perceived value.  The most mispriced
programmers are those at the high end, the so called "rock stars" and
"ninjas", so these programmers have the most to gain from open source.
