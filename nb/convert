I've managed to survive nearly a decade now without having to purchase
Microsoft Office or its most popular components: Word, Excel and PowerPoint.
I refuse to pay $380.00 every couple years for such awful software.
Of course, every so often, someone sends me .doc, .ppt or .xls, and they
expect me to be able to read it, modify it and send it back.
To deal with a Microsoft Office file, these approaches are sorted in
order of increasing cost and effectiveness: (1) Google Docs: Google's
free, online office suite.  (2) catdoc, catppt and xls2csv: Free Mac OS
X and Linux/Unix command-line tools.  (3) Open Office: A freely
available alternative to Microsoft Office.  (4) Apple iWork: Apple's
office suite for the Mac, about $70.
 ¹ By the way, it's good netiquette to send files as plain text if
possible, and pdf if not.


nb odt2txt sxw ods odp open office document xml plain text
A simple converter from OpenDocument Text to plain text.
http://stosberg.net/odt2txt/

odt2txt is a command-line tool which extracts the text out of OpenDocument
Texts produced by OpenOffice.org, StarOffice, KOffice and others.
odt2txt can also extract text from some file formats similar to Open
Document Text, such as OpenOffice.org XML (*.sxw), which was used by
OpenOffice.org version 1.x and older StarOffice versions.  To a lesser
extend, odt2txt may be useful to extract content from OpenDocument
spreadsheets (*.ods) and OpenDocument presentations (*.odp).
odt2txt is small, supports multiple output encodings, adopts to your
locale, able to substitute common characters—which the output charset
does not contain—with ascii look-a-likes, written in C so has few
dependencies, portable (runs on Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, Windows, Cygwin,
Solaris, HP-UX), and licensed under GPL version 2.
