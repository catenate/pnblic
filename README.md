nb notabene describe notebook tool nb rc script nbindex search  
Notabene is a distributed, keyword-indexed notebook tool.  The rc script  
`bin/nb` collects lines which start with `nb ` from each file in the  
current directory, and sorts these into the file `nbindex`.  If given a  
parameter, it searches these index lines for the parameter.
