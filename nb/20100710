http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:List_of_protologisms_by_topic

Here is a list of proposed or (at least presently) narrowly diffused
neologisms (newly invented yet not widely accepted words or phrases) for
English (with a very short description to save time for those wishing to
just get a bird's eye glimpse of their intended meanings).  Feel free to
add additional suggested words for others to consider (see instructions
below on adding new words).  Humorous additions can be added if they do
fill an expressive gap; they can be identified with italics.

At the very heart of winged flight lies the banked turn, a procedure
that by now seems so routine and familiar that airline passengers
appreciate neither its elegance and mystery nor its dangerously delusive
character.  The author, a pilot, takes us up into the subject

An AIDS vaccine may be one step closer after scientists found antibodies
in the blood of a patient that kill more than 90 percent of HIV strains,
according to a study in the online version of the journal Science.
The AIDS virus constantly mutates, posing a moving target for vaccine
developers.  The antibodies described in Science take advantage of an
area of the virus that is the same in nearly all strains.  The proteins
block the virus from latching onto the surface of healthy immune system
cells in an area known as the CD4 molecule.
