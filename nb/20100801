nb critic rated akirakurosawa respect film list
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurosawa

On the sets of his productions, he could be very hard on newcomers to
his team and even sometimes on seasoned, highly respected film
professionals.  During the filming of Yojimbo, he lost his temper with
cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, who has been called “quite simply,
Japan’s preeminent cinematographer”.  But when one of Miyagawa’s
assistants asked him, “Why don’t you get angry when Kurosawa yells at
you?” Miyagawa answered, “Look at Kurosawa.  He devotes himself
completely to his work.  No other director works so hard to achieve the
ideal shot he has envisioned in his mind.  I have no right to say
anything to someone like him.”
