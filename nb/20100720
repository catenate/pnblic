	jar cf jar-file input-file(s)

This command will generate a compressed JAR file and place it in the
current directory.  The command will also generate a default manifest
file for the JAR archive.  The c option indicates that you want to
create a JAR file.  The f option indicates that you want the output to
go to a file rather than to stdout.  jar-file is the name that you want
the resulting JAR file to have.  You can use any filename for a JAR file.
By convention, JAR filenames are given a .jar extension, though this is
not required.  The input-file(s) argument is a space-separated list of
one or more files that you want to include in your JAR file.  The input-
file(s) argument can contain the wildcard * symbol.  If any of the
"input-files" are directories, the contents of those directories are
added to the JAR archive recursively.  The c and f options can appear in
either order, but there must not be any space between them.

Where would we physically hold it?  Maybe a mailing list, a google
group, would be better before organizing a face-to-face meeting.
