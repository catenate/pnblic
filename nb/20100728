nb cognitive surplus participate internet revolution clayshirky
Shirky, C.  20080426.  Gin, television, and social surplus.  Here comes everybody.
http://www.shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html

Here’s something four-year-olds know: A screen that ships without a
mouse ships broken.  Here’s something four-year-olds know: Media that’s
targeted at you but doesn’t include you may not be worth sitting still for.
Those are things that make me believe that this is a one-way change.
Because four year olds, the people who are soaking most deeply in the
current environment, who won’t have to go through the trauma that I have
to go through of trying to unlearn a childhood spent watching Gilligan’s Island,
they just assume that media includes consuming, producing and sharing.
It’s also become my motto, when people ask me what we’re doing—and when
I say “we” I mean the larger society trying to figure out how to deploy
this cognitive surplus, but I also mean we, especially, the people in
this room, the people who are working hammer and tongs at figuring out
the next good idea.  From now on, that’s what I’m going to tell them:
We’re looking for the mouse.  We’re going to look at every place that a
reader or a listener or a viewer or a user has been locked out, has been
served up passive or a fixed or a canned experience, and ask ourselves,
“If we carve out a little bit of the cognitive surplus and deploy it here,
could we make a good thing happen?” And I’m betting the answer is yes.

nb physics cosmology model time space gravity constant light speed expand contract bigbang

Cosmological models with no big bang.
http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1750

Shu's idea is that time and space are not independent entities but can
be converted back and forth between each other.  In his formulation of
the geometry of spacetime, the speed of light is simply the conversion
factor between the two.  Similarly, mass and length are interchangeable
in a relationship in which the conversion factor depends on both the
gravitational constant G and the speed of light, neither of which need
be constant.  So as the Universe expands, mass and time are converted to
length and space and vice versa as it contracts.  This universe has no
beginning or end, just alternating periods of expansion and contraction.
In fact, Shu shows that singularities cannot exist in this cosmos.
