nb process table pgrep pkill
pgrep, pkillâ€”look up or signal processes based on name and other attributes
http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?pgrep+1

pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the
process IDs which matches the selection criteria to stdout.  All the
criteria have to match.  For example, `pgrep -u root sshd` will only
list the processes called sshd AND owned by root.  On the other hand,
`pgrep -u root,daemon` will list the processes owned by root OR daemon.
pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each
process instead of listing them on stdout.
