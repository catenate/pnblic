Talking about what you're going to do isn't actually doing anything.


nb ernesthemingway stop interrupt obvious progress roalddahl
Stop when you least want to stop, to start again easy and avoid writer's
block.

EH: The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you
know what will happen next.  If you do that every day … you will never
be stuck.  Always stop while you are going good and don’t think about
it or worry about it until you start to write the next day.  That way
your subconscious will work on it all the time.  But if you think about
it consciously or worry about it you will kill it and your brain will be
tired before you start.

RD: I never come back to a blank page; I always finish about halfway
through.  Hemingway taught me the finest trick: “When you are going
good, stop writing.” You don’t go on writing and writing until you
come to the end of it, because when you do, then you say, well, where am
I going to go next?  You make yourself stop and you walk away.  And you
can’t wait to get back because you know what you want to say next.

Getting Things Done
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done

GTD rests on the principle that a person needs to move tasks out of the
mind by recording them externally.  That way, the mind is freed from the
job of remembering everything that needs to be done, and can concentrate
on actually performing those tasks.
