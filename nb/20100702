http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Main_Page

Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site.  The idea is to present
solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible,
to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a
person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.
Rosetta Code currently has 401 tasks, and covers over 200 languages,
though we do not (and cannot) have solutions to every task in every
language.  (Though you can help with that!) A variety of tasks are
listed, and visitors to this site are invited to solve the tasks in the
language of their choice.  The tasks cover everything from the mundane
Empty Program to the classic Towers of Hanoi, the practical User Input,
the mathematically-inclined Lucas-Lehmer test, and the involved yet
entertaining RCRPG.

Chrestomathy (from the Greek words /khrestos/, useful, and /mathein/, to know)
is a collection of choice literary passages, used especially as an aid
in learning a foreign language.  In philology or in the study of literature,
it is a type of reader or anthology which presents a sequence of example texts,
selected to demonstrate the development of language or literary style.
In computer programming, a /program chrestomathy/ is a collection of
similar programs written in various programming languages, for the
purpose of demonstrating differences in syntax, semantics and idioms for
each language.  This term is thought to have been first used by Eric S.
Raymond in the Retrocomputing Museum web site.  It is used by analogy to
a linguistic chrestomathy.

The only fair way to represent an estimate is as a probability distribution.
Eg mean and sigma.

Simplicity or elimination of clutter.  Asymmetry or irregularity.
Beautiful by being understated, or by being precisely what it was meant
to be and not elaborated upon.  Naturalness: Absence of pretense or
artificiality, full creative intent unforced.  Profundity or suggestion
rather than revelation.  Freedom from habit or formula.  Tranquility or
an energized calm (quite), stillness, solitude.
