nb rails version command
Ruby, S. et al.  2010.  Agile web development with Rails, 4ed beta.
Pragmatic bookshelf.
/home/jdc/Dropbox/doc/pragprog/agile-web-development-with-rails_b6_0.txt:/rails _3.0.0.* --version/

On any rails command, you can control which version of Rails is used by
inserting the full version number surrounded by underscores before the
first parameter of the command:	`rails _3.0.0.beta4_ --version`.
This is particularly handy when you create a new application, because
once you create an application with a specific version of Rails, it will
continue to use that version of Rails—even if newer versions are
installed on the system—until you decide it is time to upgrade.
To upgrade, simply update the version number in the Gemfile that is in
the root directory of your application, and run `bundle install`.


nb project idea command line refactor tool ide ruby
With Ruby, however, much of this support just isn’t necessary.
Editors such as TextMate give you 90 percent of what you’d get from an
IDE but are far lighter weight.  Just about the only useful IDE facility
that’s missing is refactoring support.
