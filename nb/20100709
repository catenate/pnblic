nb english ambiguous grammar garden path sentence phrase surprise meaning
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence

The garden path effect is created by a (grammatically allowed) lack of
punctuation—usually commas to divide clauses—or the lack of the word "that".
Other contributing factors include confusing word order, where related
words are separated from each other (married; families), or a lack of
clear possession (government plans), which can cause confusion between
the verb and noun forms of a word.
