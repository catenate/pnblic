nb story point estimate time complexity agile plan
Hazrati, V. -20100706.  Do story points relate to complexity or time?
InfoQ: Agile techniques.
http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/07/story-points-complexity-effort

The goal of estimating is to answer questions such as “When will you be
done?” or “How much functionality can we have by the given date?”
If that is true, then whatever unit we estimate in and whatever approach
we use will need to be about time.

nb java lang class process builder se6

Starting a new process which uses the default working directory and
environment is easy.

	Process p = new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg").start();
 
Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working
directory and environment.

	ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg1", "myArg2");
	Map<String, String> env = pb.environment();
	env.put("VAR1", "myValue");
	env.remove("OTHERVAR");
	env.put("VAR2", env.get("VAR1") + "suffix");
	pb.directory(new File("myDir"));
	Process p = pb.start();
 
To start a process with an explicit set of environment variables, first
call Map.clear() before adding environment variables.
