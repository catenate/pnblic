nb social micro payment share money fund month flattr

Flattr is a social micropayments system.  However, you must be willing
to give to get.  In other words, before you can get flattred you need to
add some funds and flattr others.  (You can add funds for several months
at a time in order to minimize payment processing/fees which is what
makes this economically more viable than previous systems.) Your monthly
allocation is then divided equally amongst all of the things you flattr
within that month.  Remember to flattr [any] things you find online and like.
If you find something on the internet that you like, but it doesn’t have
a flattr button, tell the site owner/creator to get a flattr account and
put up a button so they can receive your love.  You can always adjust
how much you want to flattr to others each month.  If you find lots of
things to flattr in one single month you can easily increase the monthly amount.

Family resources for growing children.
http://www.brighthorizons.com/growing/

Bright Horizons has a web site with activities for "growing scientists"
and "growing readers", a newsletter, information on staying healthy,
learning at home, and specific lesson plans to get kids ready for school.
I like this kind of condensed, vetted, planned stuff over random web sites.

Software.  log-malloc—log malloc/free with stack trace.  netboot—simple
pxe-compatible dhcp and tftp server.  procstat—displays linux proc stat
(/proc/pid/stat) in human-readable format.  tinyserial—small minicom
replacement.  udp_redirect—udp port forwarder.  tinycaptcha—CAPTCHA
anti-bot image generator.  git-loc—LOC count for git.

Projects.  Click Forth.  WarSim.

Proof-of-concept.  fo.py, mighty Forth Lisp SmallTalk mix in Python.
Web server in 58 lines of C. Making weird things: Metaprogramming in C.

Thoughts.  iptables MASQUERADE vs SNAT - mistery of netfilter.  I want
mix of Forth, Lisp and Smalltalk.  Taking advantages of a bottleneck.
C will kick Python ass forever.  poll vs epoll.  Libc usage.  Linux is
not special.  Nice look matters.  Start from scratch.
Software development is a service.  Web2.0 makes development easier.

nb rails dispatcher reload development code
/home/jdc/Dropbox/doc/pragprog/agile-web-development-with-rails_b6_0.txt:/Rails dispatcher/

It turns out that the Rails dispatcher is pretty clever.  In development
mode (as opposed to testing or production), it automatically reloads
application source ﬁles when a new request comes along.  That way, when
we edit our application, the dispatcher makes sure it’s running the most
recent changes.
