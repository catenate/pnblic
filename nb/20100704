nb web page line length
Weakley, R.  20030503.  Ideal line length for content.  maxdesign.
http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/em/

Using a standard piece of text like “Lorem ipsum…” it seems that an
ideal like length in ems is about 30–35.  This is expressed with the rule:

	width: 30em;

The beauty of this is that this measurement relates the user’s font size.
If you come to a site with a default font size of smaller or larger,
the column width will always stay within the optimal range.
