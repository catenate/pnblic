nb homebrew unix macports
http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools
Apple didn’t include with OS X. A very promising alternative to
MacPorts.  And, since Homebrew sensibly installs under /usr/local, you
can give it a try without mucking up your existing MacPorts
installations (though if you plan to switch, getting rid of MacPorts
entirely seems like a good idea).


nb switch application
Liteswitch X
http://www.proteron.com/

After a four year development hiatus, Liteswitch X returns, adding extra
features to OS X’s built-in Application Switcher: you can optionally
display applications running in the background, force quit applications
from the switcher, and hide applications you never switch to from view.

(Or, to put it another way, Apple ‘borrowed’ the Liteswitch X interface
when they introduced the Application Switcher in Panther, but they
forgot to ‘borrow’ some of its best features.)
