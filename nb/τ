nb tau π pi circle constant radius fail
Hartl, M.  2010τ.  The tau manifesto.

The Tau Manifesto is dedicated to the proposition that the proper
response to “π is wrong” is “No, /really/.” And the true circle constant
deserves a proper name.  As you may have guessed by now, the Tau
Manifesto proposes that this name should be the Greek letter τ (tau):

	τ ≡ circle constant ≡ C/r = 6.283185307…
	where C is the circumference of a circle and r its radius

Throughout the rest of this manifesto, we will see that the number is
the correct choice, and we will show through usage (Section 2 and
Section 3) and by direct argumentation (Section 4) that the letter is a
natural choice as well.

The unnecessary factors of 2 arising from the use of π are annoying
enough by themselves, but far more serious is their tendency to /cancel/
when divided by any even number.  The absurd results, such as π/2 for a
/quarter/ circle, obscure the underlying relationship between angle
measure and the circle constant.  To those who maintain that it “doesn’t
matter” whether we use π or τ when teaching trigonometry, I simply ask
you to view Figure 6, Figure 7, and Figure 8 through the eyes of a child.
You will see that, from the perspective of a beginner, using π instead
of τ is a pedagogical disaster.
