HiBase: A Persistent Functional Programming Environment
http://hibase.cs.hut.fi/

The goal of the HiBase project was to develop a high-performance
database programming environment with challenging additional features
required in telecom environments.  These features include high performance,
heterogeneous transaction load, complex dynamic database schemes,
multi-dimensional indexing, main-memory databases with real-time response,
and very high availability ensured by replication and instantaneous takeover.
Jun 25 2009: Nokia-Siemens Networks, the current copyright holder of HiBase,
has double-licensed the code written by employees of Helsinki University
of Technology in the HiBase-project under the MIT-license in addition to GPL (v2).
The same hereby is granted to all later additions to the source code.

Below is a small CSS tip of how to define and override anchor styles
correctly.  This example demonstrates the use of the pseudo-classes.
Most common anchor pseudo-classes are: link, visited, hover, active.
Define and override anchor styles:

	a:link	{ color:red; text-decoration:underline; }
	a:visited	{ color:red; text-decoration:underline; }
	a:hover	{ color:green; text-decoration:underline; }
	a:active	{ color:red; text-decoration:underline; }

	a.otherLink:link	{ color:red; text-decoration:none; }
	a.otherLink:visited	{ color:red; text-decoration:none; }
	a.otherLink:hover	{ color:green; text-decoration:underline; }
	a.otherLink:active	{ color:red; text-decoration:none; }
